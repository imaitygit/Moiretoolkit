## Compute Order Parameter from LAMMPS file 

* Compute the Projected Density of States (PDOS) for a circular patch by running
python `pdos.py`

* Plot the data
python `plot.py`


## Installation
This code uses python3 (tested on python3.9),
+ matplotlib,
+ numpy.
You also need the `WS2.PDOS` file for a fine grid from SIESTA. 
Due to large size of the file, we haven't included the file.
